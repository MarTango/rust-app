## Description

I'm trying to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). After playing
around with this project I realised that a lot of the stuff I read in
[the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) went in one eye and out
the other (lol).

I'm just gonna try and make some kinda webapp that stores data of all
shapes and sizes.
